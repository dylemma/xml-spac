/** Handler that forwards inputs to a first handler until that handler yields a result, at which point the result
  * is used to create a second handler, to which all further inputs are forwarded until it yields a result.
  *
  * Before the second handler is generated, the input "stack" is tracked so that it can be replayed to the second
  * handler (so that it can acquire the correct context even though it was not available when the inputs forming
  * that context were initially handled). The "stack" behavior is generalized with the `Stackable` typeclass.
  *
  * An example usage of this is to faciliate creation of a Parser for an XML element which starts with some "dictionary"
  * element, followed by a large number of "data" objects that reference the dictionary. Normally, a user of xml-spac
  * would have to choose between;
  *  - loading the large list of data objects into a List (high memory usage) in order to use regular parser combination methods like `and`
  *  - creating an external map and having the dictionary parser side effect by populating the map, and the data object parser read from
  *    that map (this is against the spirit of xml-spac since it breaks the immutability/encapsulation of the parser).
  * Instead, with this handler, the user can write a parser for the dictionary element and have its result be passed
  * into the parser for its sibling elements (the data elements). No external mutable state is required.
  *
  * @param handler1 The first handler
  * @param getHandler2 A function to generate the second handler from the first handler's result
  * @tparam In The input type
  * @tparam T1 The first handler's result type
  * @tparam T2 The second handler's result type
